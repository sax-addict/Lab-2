    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>There are 5 empty links that could be removed or changed to plain text to improve speeds</p>
    <p>There are 5 redundant links that also could be removed</p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>lots of the images don't have alt text, so adding that would be good</p>
    <p>There are a lot of text boxes with low contrast such as the search bar</p>
